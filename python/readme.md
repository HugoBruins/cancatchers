## Information

There are currently 3 codes in here, `live monitoring` is the code that saves the Serial information to a text file and plots the simple temperature/pressure/altitude data afterwards.

`Codeforplotting2` is made to replot the text file created by live monitoring, but also plots the GPS data if there is any, we kept `cloteverything` because it gives a nice preview on how all the data will be plotted (see [readme](https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/Plot%20everything#graphs) for graphs ).
