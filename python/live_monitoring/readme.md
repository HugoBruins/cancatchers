## Information

This piece of code is amazing! You plop in your ground station usb-port, start up the code, start the cansat and this will log all the received data into a text file, while also plotting the data afterward. I am planning on making some adjustments so you can see the current distance between the Cansat, this will be fun for a distance test. 

## Picture

Notice how there are 2 peaks: Those are my fingers on the temperature sensor just to check if there was much delay between the monitored information, and it was almost 0.
