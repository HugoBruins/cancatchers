# Information

The code makes 3 different plots as of now, one has all the data graphs of altitude, pressure, temperature, wind / horizontal speed. The other graph is a 2d map with all the latitude and longitude information plotted and the third graph is a 3 dimensional graph that has latitude and longitude, but also altitude information plotted, sadly I cannot get a nice image of the map for the 3d graph. 

The data from these pictures is taken from a caveman distance test with our old transceiver modules. 

## Graphs:

### The temperature / pressure / wind speed / altitude plot
