# Information

This code can plot the data that is generated from [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring").

It does this again no matter if the gps module failed or not but this one also has the possibilty of plotting the gps data in a nice 3d map, just like in the deprecated [ploteverything.py](https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/(DEPRECATED)%20Plot%20everything "ploteverything version 1").

#### To show if it works: Here is the picture generated by [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring"):

#### And here is the picture generated by this code (from the text file that [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring") generated):

Notice how these figures are the same. 

# Instructions: 

1. Let [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring") generate a data file or use the datafile generated by the SD card.
2. Put this file in the same file as the code (codeforplotting2.py).
3. If you have any gps data, generate a map.png as told in these [instructions](https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/(DEPRECATED)%20Plot%20everything#how-can-i-get-my-own-map-image "instructions"). Drop the map.png in the same file as the code and your text file.

For plotting from an SD card text file:
1. Edit codeforplotting2.py using whatever IDE you use, and change `data_file_name = 'receiver_data.txt'` to whatever the text file is called.
2. Repeat steps 1 to 3 from above.
