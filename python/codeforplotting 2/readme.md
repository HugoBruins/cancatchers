## information

This code can plot the data that is generated from [style]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring")

It does this again no matter if the gps module failed or notm but this one also has the possibilty of plotting the gps data in a nice 3d map, just like in [style](https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/Plot%20everything "ploteverything version 1")

To show if it works: Here is the picture generated by [style]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring")
