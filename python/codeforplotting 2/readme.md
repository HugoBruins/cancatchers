# Information

This code can plot the data that is generated from [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring").

It does this again no matter if the gps module failed or not but this one also has the possibilty of plotting the gps data in a nice 3d map, just like in [ploteverything version 1.py](https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/Plot%20everything "ploteverything version 1").

#### To show if it works: Here is the picture generated by [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring"):

#### And here is the picture generated by this code (from the text file that [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring") generated):

Notice how these figures are the same. 

# Instructions: 

1. Let [live_monitoring.py]( https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/live_monitoring "live_monitoring") generate a data file.
2. Put this file in the same file as the code (codeforplotting2.py)
3. If you have any gps data, generate a map.png as told in these [instructions](https://github.com/HugoBruins/cancatchers/tree/master/python/Plot%20everything#how-can-i-get-my-own-map-image "instructions"). Drop the map.png in the same file as the code and your text file.
4. Edit codeforplotting2.py using whatever IDE you use, and change 
   > data_file_name = '28receiver_data.txt'
   to whatever your text file is called, if you didn't change anything from the monitoring code this should only be a number
5. Run the code and profit
