## Library dependencies
- EBYTE.h

## Extra information
- It is important that if you have the temperature sensor with gps working, that you use the groundstation_all.ino, because the received struct has to be the same as the send struct.
- if only the GPS and the transmitter is working, use groundstation_gps.ino.
